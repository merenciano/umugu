    "Venga, a ver si te buscas una musiquilla guapa, Â¿no colega?" - El Pirri.

    The audio pipeline handles signals with this config:
      - Channels = 2
      - Sample rate = 48000
      - Data type = Float32

    The audio sources that read files can open other configs, but the
     signal gets converted to that config before leaving the source node.
    The same happens for output. It can have other configs but all the pipeline
     will be processed with the default signal config until the end, then
     the signal will be converted to the desired output format.

    TODO(Err)
    TODO(qol)
    TODO:
        - Make it work using int16 or even uint8, instead of float32. I want
          this to work on a ESP32.
        - Simple and performant hash for umugu_name to be used as a key in
          associative containers (although I'm quite sure that linear search
          over contiguous data using 1 memcmp per node is probably faster with
          the few elements that this library usually has).
        - Conversions between signal configurations.
        - Sanitize build config.
        - Profiling build config.
        - Doxygen.
        - Adapt to any wav config (mono, stereo, samples per sec, data size..)
        - File players for compressed formats.
        - Think about separating node config/parameter data (the one that
          controllers and UI modifies) from internal state (the one that
          the signal processing thread modifies). It's nice to hace all the
          node data together but I would like to have all the configurable
          data of the pipeline grouped for better serialization (I'm importing
          and exporting the whole chunk of pipeline data anyway but half of it
          is useless state). Or maybe I should go all-in and serialize the
          whole application state in order to make snapshots of any given
          moment for debug/inspection... or mmap the whole context to a binary
          file for easy autosaves.. or just memset and mask all the state and
          padding data and feed it to any runtime compression algorithm.

        - Organize all the config and decide how it's done. File? Defines?
        - Change pointers with arena offsets in serialized structs (I want .bin
   compat between 32-64 bit systems).
        - Get rid of heap allocations.
